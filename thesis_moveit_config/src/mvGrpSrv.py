## BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL imports
##
## To use the Python MoveIt! interfaces, we will import the `moveit_commander`_ namespace.
## This namespace provides us with a `MoveGroupCommander`_ class, a `PlanningSceneInterface`_ class,
## and a `RobotCommander`_ class. (More on these below)
##
## We also import `rospy`_ and some messages that we will use:
##

import sys
import copy
import rospy
import moveit_commander
import moveit_msgs.msg
import geometry_msgs.msg
from math import pi
from std_msgs.msg import String
from moveit_commander.conversions import pose_to_list
from thesis_msgs.srv import *

    """

    @param: goal       A list of floats, a Pose or a PoseStamped
    @param: actual     A list of floats, a Pose or a PoseStamped

        ## BEGIN_SUB_TUTORIAL setup
        ##
        ## First initialize `moveit_commander`_ and a `rospy`_ node:
        moveit_commander.roscpp_initialize(sys.argv)
        # rospy.init_node('move_group_python_interface',
        #                anonymous=True)

        ## Instantiate a `RobotCommander`_ object. This object is the outer-level interface to
        ## the robot:
        robot = moveit_commander.RobotCommander()

        ## Instantiate a `PlanningSceneInterface`_ object.  This object is an interface
        ## to the world surrounding the robot:
        scene = moveit_commander.PlanningSceneInterface()

        ## Instantiate a `MoveGroupCommander`_ object.  This object is an interface
        ## to one group of joints.  In this case the group is the joints in the Panda
        ## arm so we set ``group_name = panda_arm``. If you are using a different robot,
        ## you should change this value to the name of your robot arm planning group.
        ## This interface can be used to plan and execute motions on the Panda:
        group_name = "iiwa_arm"
        group = moveit_commander.MoveGroupCommander(group_name)

        ## We create a `DisplayTrajectory`_ publisher which is used later to publish
        ## trajectories for RViz to visualize:
        display_trajectory_publisher = rospy.Publisher('/move_group/display_planned_path',
                                                        moveit_msgs.msg.DisplayTrajectory,
